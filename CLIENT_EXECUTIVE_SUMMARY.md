## 🎯 What We've Built

We've successfully created a professional, self-hosted platform designed to replace your GotPhoto workflow and give you full ownership of data, UX, and costs. Key deliverables:

### ✅ 1. Pre-Order Registration &amp; Checkout
- **12-step registration wizard** customized to your current workflow and parent-facing experience
- **All conditional logic** recreated (school/project selection, backdrops, package options, sibling discounts)
- **Mobile-first, accessible UI** with faster load times than typical hosted solutions
- **Real-time price calculations** and dynamic package previews
- **Stripe payment integration** configured for secure checkout (can be swapped to another gateway)

### ✅ 2. Admin Dashboard &amp; Studio Tools
- **/admin management console** with role-based access
- **Real-time KPIs**: registrations, orders, revenue, and fulfillment status
- **Order &amp; project management**: filter, search, bulk actions, and status updates
- **Full control over schools, events, packages, pricing, and promotional codes**

### ✅ 3. Customer Portal (Self-Service)
- **/my-account** portal where customers view orders, invoices, and images (proofing when enabled)
- **Order edits and reprints** workflow to reduce manual support
- **Automated receipts and confirmations**

### ✅ 4. Payments, Emails &amp; Notifications
- **Stripe-ready payments** (customizable)
- **SendGrid configured** for transactional and marketing emails (optional)
- **Configurable notification templates** for registrations, payment confirmations, and reminders

### ✅ 5. Data Ownership &amp; Integrations
- **Customer &amp; order data stored in your database** (portable CSV/API export)
- **Integration points** ready for lab fulfillments, accounting exports, and other studio services

## 💰 How This Helps Your Business

### Immediate Benefits
- ✅ Reduce reliance on GotPhoto and similar hosted platforms — more control over pricing and workflow
- ✅ Lower recurring platform costs and fewer per-order limitations
- ✅ Faster registration experience — improved conversion on mobile
- ✅ Centralized data — easier reporting and customer communications
- ✅ Built for accessibility — better experience for all parents and guardians

### Business Impact (expected)
- Cost reduction: fewer platform subscription/usage fees (actual savings depend on your GotPhoto plan and volumes)
- Time savings: automation and self-service reduce manual tasks (estimate: 8–15 hours/week saved)
- Revenue uplift: better UX and cross-sell recommendations increase conversion and AOV
- Scalability: self-hosted stack scales without per-seat or per-event fees

## ⚠️ GotPhoto-specific Considerations
To ensure a smooth transition we recommend validating the following (we can handle these as part of migration services):
- Photo galleries &amp; proofing parity — GotPhoto offers gallery/proofing features; confirm which workflows you use
- Lab integrations and fulfillment exports — map any existing lab/export formats
- Pricing &amp; package mappings — ensure custom packages, school splits, taxes, and discounts migrate correctly
- Customer communications templates — replicate any automated messages parents currently receive

We will document any gaps and provide a migration checklist and timeline.

## 🚀 Roadmap: AI &amp; Growth

### Phase 1 — Intelligent Customer Support (2–4 weeks)
- Chatbot + answer base for common parent questions (reduces support volume)
- Integration with email &amp; admin to escalate complex cases

### Phase 2 — Smart Image Selection (4–6 weeks)
- AI-assisted best-shot selection and suggested product pairings for proofing galleries
- Personalized upsell suggestions in the checkout flow

### Phase 3 — Marketing &amp; Analytics (2–3 months)
- Segmented email campaigns, predictive registration forecasting, and A/B testing
- Dashboarded metrics to optimize pricing and bundles

Expected outcomes (conservative estimates):
- 10–25% increase in average order value
- 40–70% reduction in routine support inquiries
- Improved retention and referral rates

## ✅ What's Ready Now
- Complete registration &amp; checkout workflow (GotPhoto-equivalent)
- Admin dashboard with user roles and basic KPIs
- Customer portal with order history
- Stripe payments and SendGrid for emails (configured)
- Mobile-responsive and accessibility-focused UI
- Data export tools for migration and backups

## 🔜 Next Steps (recommended)
1. This Week: Configure production API keys, enable HTTPS, end-to-end smoke tests  
2. Next 2 Weeks: Run a migration dry-run for a single event; confirm gallery/proofing behavior  
3. Next Month: Enable AI support assistant (pilot) and add reCAPTCHA/signature capture as needed  
4. Next 2 Months: Launch full AI features and marketing automation

## ✅ Deployment &amp; Handoff
We provide:
- Deployment checklist (Docker/Forge/host instructions)
- Admin training (recorded video + short runbook)
- Post-launch support window (2 weeks) for bug fixes and tweaks

## 💡 Bottom Line
You now have a fully controlled, modern studio platform purpose-built to replace GotPhoto workflows while improving UX, reducing platform costs, and unlocking AI-driven growth.

**Ready to proceed with migration and production rollout.**
